           This is my first project, so all feedback is welcome.</p>
           <p> I'm on a journey to <strong>self discovery</strong>. I'll be using this blog to share various sides of me.
           My interests, desires, opinions, and anything else I deem fit <!Its my blog>. I hope I'll be able to
          keep your attention long enough. </p>

      <h2 class="post-title"> The Transfiguration of Saudi Arabia</h2>
       <div class="post-content">
         <p> This morning I came across an interesting <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/04/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-wants-to-be-black-panthers-tchalla-so-badly.html">article</a> on the reopening of cinemas and public concerts in Saudi Arabia and I'm excited.
     To be honest, if I was asked what countries did not have cinemas I would probably have guessed Saudi Arabia (they sort of have a reputation) but the thought never crossed my mind that there were countries which still banned cinemas. In 2018.
   anyway, the Crown Prince Muhammad who ascended the throne late last year has implemented a number of reforms, of which the reopening of cinemas is one.
  Prince Muhammad is really on a wave, trying to be progressive and all. He's there letting women drive, getting them better jobs and so much more. I guess its safe to say that
things are getting better for the average Saudi Arabian. At least thats what it looks like from the outside.</p>
         <p> Back to our cinema gist. Guess what movie is going to be the first movie shown when cinemas open. Yep! thats right, Black Panther.
         So a young Monarch who just ascended the throne and is trying to transform his country lifts a cinema ban and the first movie to be shown is about a young monarch
       who just ascended the throne and is trying to transform his country. hmm,nice. </p>
        <p> Well, just incase you were wondering if there are other countries with cinema bans,here is a <a href="https://google.com/countrieswithcinemabans">list</a>. Educate yourself.
        Till next time, cheers !</p>
